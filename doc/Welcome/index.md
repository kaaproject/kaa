Welcome to the Kaa IoT platform documentation!

Kaa is a highly flexible, multi-purpose, 100% open-source middleware platform for implementing complete end-to-end IoT solutions, connected applications, and smart products.
For a quick start, Kaa offers a set of out-of-the-box enterprise-grade IoT features that can be easily plugged in and used to implement a large majority of the IoT use cases.
The platform features include device management, data collection, configuration management, messaging, and more.
See [Key platform features]({{root_url}}Programming-guide/Key-platform-features/) section for details.

>**NOTE:** You can also refer to the older Kaa documentation [for versions prior to 0.10.0](http://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Kaa+IoT+Platform+Home).

## Getting started
For a quick start with the Kaa IoT platform, check out [Getting started]({{root_url}}Getting-started/) guide.
Alternatively, you can [deploy Kaa into your own environment]({{root_url}}Administration-guide/System-installation/Single-node-installation/).

Once you have your instance of Kaa up and running, use [Your first Kaa application]({{root_url}}Programming-guide/Your-first-Kaa-application/) guide to get the basics of building applications with Kaa.
For your client applications, you can choose among several implementations of the [Kaa endpoint SDK]({{root_url}}Programming-guide/Using-Kaa-endpoint-SDKs/) in different languages and for different platforms.

Kaa platform architecture is covered in [Architecture overview]({{root_url}}Architecture-overview/).
