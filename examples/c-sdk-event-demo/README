PREFACE
************************************

This demo application illustrates the Kaa event feature using the Kaa C SDK.
To read more about the logging feature, visit https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Events.

************************************
INSTALLATION
************************************

To run the demo application, do the following:

1. Install third-party libraries to build the Kaa C SDK.
Follow https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/Third-party+components#Third-partycomponents-Kaaendpoint to see the full
list of third-party dependencies for the Kaa C SDK.
2. Download and install the Kaa sandbox (https://docs.kaaproject.org/display/KAA/sandbox).
3. Before generating the C SDK, make sure that you provided the SDK with a user verifier and the following fields for the event class family were specified as follows:
 Name: ThermostatEventClassFamily
 Namespace: org.kaaproject.kaa.schema.sample.event.thermo
 Class name: ThermostatEventClassFamily
 (The Avro log schema required for the demo application is located in the 'avro' directory).
4. Generate the C SDK using the Kaa sandbox. Put the SDK archive into the 'libs/kaa' directory.
5. Use the build.sh script to build and run the demo application (the 'deploy' option).
